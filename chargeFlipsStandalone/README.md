# Standalone implementation of charge flip measurement

Needed to run on files prepared by Gianny,
that do not have all available branches stored to run in the usual way...

Note: only the filling needs to be modified; the plotting can run as before.
For the plotting (e.g. plotMCChargeFlipMeasurement.py and plotMCClosureTest.py),
it is recommended to just use the scripts in the chargeFlips folder.
With the appropriate command line arguments, they can be used to run
on the files in this folder directly, without further modifications.
This is probably better than duplicating these scripts here.
