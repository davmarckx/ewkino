**Code for selecting interesting events for event displays**

The functionality in this folder only selects interesting events in data
(by performing the selection and looking at high BDT values)
and returns a list of event ids.
The further processing should be done in CMSSW, 
see Joscha and the documentation on the "fireworks" too (see lognotes).

This has so far only been used for a high school student project, 
not for the actual tZq analysis.
