**Trigger scale factors**

The current file `triggerSF.root` is generated by simply running `hadd` on the trigger scale factor files per year.  
For example, the latest version is generated as follows:  
`hadd -f triggerSF.root ../../../ttWAnalysis/triggerefficiency/output_20240321_2d/*/basic_recoptcuts/scalefactors/scalefactors_*.root`
