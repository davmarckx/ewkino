# Sample lists for 4tops measurement.

Date: 22/09/2022  

Will use these samples to perform a double task:  
- test the event selection, flattening and binning code on the new ttW branch.  
- run nonprompt control regions for the recently measured fake rate for the 4tops analysis.  
For the first reason above, these nonprompt control regions are not run on the fourtops\_fakerate\_ul branch, but instead on this new ttW branch!  

The MC sample lists are copied (with style modifications) from here:  
`https://github.com/NielsVdBossche/ewkino/blob/Experimental/sampleLists/2018.txt`  
and similar for the other years.

The samples are located physically in:
`/pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/nivanden/skims_v4`  
for simulation and  
`/pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/nivanden/skims_v5`  
for data.
