# samples located in:
# - /pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/llambrec/dileptonskim_ttw_signal
#   (old samples, with particle level configuration not completely in sync with Oviedo/nanoAOD, and with a dilepton skim)
#   (not recommended to be used anymore!)
# - /pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/llambrec/noskim_ttw_signal
#   (same particle level configuration as above (?), but no dilepton skim)
#   (not recommended to be used, not thoroughly tested, maybe remove at some point!)
# - /pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/llambrec/noskim_ttw_signal_nanoaodsettings
#   (particle level configuration synced with Oviedo/nanoAOD)
#   (should use these ones!)
