# Pileup reweighting files

The files were retrieved from here: 
https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-nanoAOD/jsonpog-integration/-/tree/master/POG/LUM
(as recommended by Joscha).

They contain the pileup reweighting factors directly,
as they are the same for each UL MC sample
(since each UL MC sample was generated with the same pileup hypothesis).
